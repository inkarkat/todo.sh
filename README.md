# todo.sh CLI extensions

_Additions and tweaks to the todo.sh CLI._

These are some personal aliases, shortcuts, and extensions that make (my) work with the [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) task tracking system easier and faster. Some of them may be specific to my environment and workflow, but maybe someone finds a valuable nugget in there.

My extensions for the TODO.TXT Command Line Interface (i.e. add-ons and filters) are over at https://github.com/inkarkat/todo.txt-cli-ex

### Dependencies

* Bash, GNU `sed`

### Installation

* The `./bin` subdirectory is supposed to be added to `PATH`.
* The [shell/aliases.sh](shell/aliases.sh) script (meant to be sourced in `.bashrc`) defines Bash aliases around the provided commands.
